# Clock-In Website

NextJS project (one-shot project) successor to an excel spreadsheet I made (Google's spreadsheet solution was a pain to work with thanks to its inconsistent time related math and displaying).

Also an excuse to develop something with neumorphism styling.

I may add a license if I make it modular and have more features (if for some reason you like this and want to thinker with it, you are free to do so, also submit an issue so I can see someone is looking at this project so I can make it better, and if you would like something add it in the issue so I can add the feature in my spare time).
